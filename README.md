## ü§î &nbsp; Why?

Libraries that make development easier are appearing every day. Styleguides and design systems are growing in popularity. Today, tools that allow us to get our best work done and be efficient are necessary. We shouldn't be spending too much time on tasks that should be trivial. This is why we created **Docz**.

Documenting code is one of the most important and time-heavy processes when you're creating something new. A lot of time is wasted on unnecessarily attempting to build a documentation site that will match the style we want.
